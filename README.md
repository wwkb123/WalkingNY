The Walking New York App will show you historic photographs of Brooklyn and Queens, as it locates the block you are on and selects photos of that site or one nearby. <br><br>

Created by the La Guardia and Wagner Archives, La Guardia Community College, CUNY, the app features images from the New York City Housing Authority Photograph Collection (housed at the La Guardia and Wagner Archives), the Queens Public Library, and the Brooklyn Historical Society. <br><br>

Users can browse the map to find all of our provided locations, as well as share photos from their locations to Facebook and Twitter. <br><br>

Currently supporting Brooklyn and Queens, we will be adding Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island soon, so users can find themselves fully “Walking New York.”
